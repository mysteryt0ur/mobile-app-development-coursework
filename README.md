**Game Instructions:**

To play, you will need at least 3 but no more than 5 players. Each player draws two squiggles, and then each player has to create two drawing masterpieces based on a random word whilst incorportating one of their fellow players squiggles. After two players have submitted their masterpieces, give each of them the time to explain why their drawing is the best. After they have finished, all of the other players should come together and decide what rating to give each drawing (either 1 point, 2 points or 3 points). This repeats until all players have created two drawings and then a winner is crowned.
